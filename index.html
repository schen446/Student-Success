<p>In the dataset above, tracks 30 students across five measures: hours studied, sleep, attendance, previous scores, and current exam results. Students with stronger prior performance and steady attendance generally score higher on the exam, while those with low study times often achieve weaker outcomes. Studying for long and heavy hours helps, but it's not a silver bullet. A few outliers with long study hours underperform, having small returns without consistent attendance or prior knowledge. Sleep varies more widely and shows a weaker and mixed relationship. Rest appears helpful but not decisive on its own. The top exam results cluster where preparation, attendance, and prior achievement meet, meaning that performance is most durable when effort is paired with showing up and building on a solid foundation.
